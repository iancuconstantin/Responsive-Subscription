# Responsive-Subscription

## What I`ve learned:

- Implement a responsive component

## Tasks

1. Implement your solution so it looks like the `mobile-design.jpg`.
    - The sites looks like the planned design when the screen width is less then 700 px

2. Implement your solution so it looks like the `desktop-design.jpg` when opened in a desktop browser.
    - The sites looks like the planned design when the screen is wider then 700 px
    - There is a "Sign up now!" hover message on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action button

3. Create a sign up form regarding the theme of the page. The form also have to be responsive.
    - When we click to the `Sign up` button, a form shows up
    - The form is fillable with name, birth date and billing address
    - When we click the `Submit` button in the form, it logs out the input values into the console
